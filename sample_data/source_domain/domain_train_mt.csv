"designing integration flows using hypercubes . the design and implementation of an etl ( extract transform load ) process for a data warehouse proceeds from a conceptual model to a logical model , and then a physical model and implementation . the conceptual model conveys at a high level the data sources and targets , and the transformation steps from sources to targets . the current state of the art is to express the conceptual model informally using text descriptions and diagrams . this makes the process of deriving a logical model time consuming and error prone . our work is towards a system that covers the whole etl lifecycle by injecting several layers of optimization and validation throughout the whole process starting with the business level objectives and ending with flow execution . in this paper , we focus on the etl conceptual layer and present a solution that assists consultants in their task of defining the needs and requirements at the early stages of an integration project . we present a conceptual model for etl based on hypercubes and hypercube operations . this is a formal model that captures the semantics of etl at a high level but that can also be machine translated into a logical model for etl . the use of hypercubes at the conceptual level renders a design that can be easily understood by business users and so reduces design and development time and produces a result that accurately captures service level agreements and business requirements .","1328,568,2340,38,12150,5,4,102,8,222,7,24,7453,23,857,1815,1411,22,122,12,9,20,3078,6119,30,9,1579,33,10,9,1379,33,6,8,141,9,615,33,8,222,5,4,1579,33,9182,62,9,103,150,4,20,390,8,2537,6,8,4,733,1179,30,390,10,2537,5,4,286,148,7,4,194,14,10,1325,4,1579,33,5694,38,144,1475,8,1903,5,17,573,4,122,7,3181,9,1379,33,44,1743,8,393,2386,5,26,110,14,719,9,40,15,2788,4,1134,7453,3980,25,8566,136,2227,7,235,8,1372,2391,4,1134,122,1957,18,4,736,150,2359,8,9987,18,413,300,5,11,17,35,6,13,355,16,4,7453,1579,1664,8,73,9,314,15,5682,13853,11,66,159,7,1776,4,567,8,310,62,4,982,1977,7,24,568,467,5,13,73,9,1579,33,12,7453,29,16,12150,8,10019,408,5,17,14,9,533,33,15,1465,4,294,7,7453,62,9,103,150,108,15,27,64,28,316,3293,85,9,1379,33,12,7453,5,4,76,7,12150,62,4,1579,150,4262,9,102,15,27,28,703,2648,25,736,77,8,244,1225,102,8,163,44,8,1216,9,188,15,944,1465,547,150,7474,8,736,310,5","0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",253,"0.00015625000000000003,0.038192448837461715,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.028460253073457294,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.02244547734623826,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.026149999093944186,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.05770127812710744,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.019139788777779075,0.017037801863755923,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.030675089664251202,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.012680508890964963,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.027134601757831986,0.31121707935621606,0.1189720557372196,0.00015625000000000003,0.012275386325828025,0.00015625000000000003,0.2722932311479445,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003,0.00015625000000000003"
"scanraw a database meta operator for parallel in situ processing and loading . traditional databases incur a significant data to query delay due to the requirement to load data inside the system before querying . since this is not acceptable in many domains generating massive amounts of raw data ( e . g . , genomics ) , databases are entirely discarded . external tables , on the other hand , provide instant sql querying over raw files . their performance across a query workload is limited though by the speed of repeated full scans , tokenizing , and parsing of the entire file . in this article , we propose scanraw , a novel database meta operator for in situ processing over raw files that integrates data loading and external tables seamlessly , while preserving their advantages optimal performance across a query workload and zero time to query . we decompose loading and external table processing into atomic stages in order to identify common functionality . we analyze alternative implementations and discuss possible optimizations for each stage . our major contribution is a parallel superscalar pipeline implementation that allows scanraw to take advantage of the current many and multicore processors by overlapping the execution of independent stages . moreover , scanraw overlaps query processing with loading by speculatively using the additional i o bandwidth arising during the conversion process for storing data into the database , such that subsequent queries execute faster . as a result , scanraw makes intelligent use of the available system resources cpu cycles and i o bandwidth by switching dynamically between tasks to ensure that optimal performance is achieved . we implement scanraw in a state of the art database system and evaluate its performance across a variety of synthetic and real world datasets . our results show that scanraw with speculative loading achieves the best possible performance for a query sequence at any point in the processing . moreover , scanraw maximizes resource utilization for the entire workload execution while speculatively loading data and without interfering with normal query processing
