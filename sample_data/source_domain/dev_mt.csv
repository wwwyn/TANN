"efficient type ahead search on relational data a tastier approach . existing keyword search systems in relational databases require users to submit a complete query to compute answers . often users feel left in the dark ' ' when they have limited knowledge about the data , and have to use a try and see approach for modifying queries and finding answers . in this paper we propose a novel approach to keyword search in the relational world , called tastier . a tastier system can bring instant gratification to users by supporting type ahead search , which finds answers on the fly ' ' as the user types in query keywords . a main challenge is how to achieve a high interactive speed for large amounts of data in multiple tables , so that a query can be answered efficiently within milliseconds . we propose efficient index structures and algorithms for finding relevant answers on the fly by joining tuples in the database . we devise a partition based method to improve query performance by grouping highly relevant tuples and pruning irrelevant tuples efficiently . we also develop a technique to answer a query efficiently by predicting the highly relevant complete queries for the user . we have conducted a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques on real data sets to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of this new search paradigm .","115,168,4256,43,16,301,20,9,3,42,5,116,800,43,57,11,301,250,484,77,10,5129,9,546,37,10,639,586,5,183,77,3474,2605,11,4,6057,32,32,112,117,47,494,157,177,4,20,6,8,47,10,76,9,2360,8,1380,42,12,3098,61,8,370,586,5,11,17,35,13,67,9,118,42,10,800,43,11,4,301,165,6,208,3,5,9,3,40,27,2285,3957,3,10,77,25,823,168,4256,43,6,31,1932,586,16,4,2434,32,32,21,4,48,195,11,37,1231,5,9,366,541,14,88,10,365,9,103,254,801,12,63,1691,7,20,11,154,1163,6,244,15,9,37,27,28,3607,311,245,6061,5,13,67,115,350,307,8,83,12,370,261,586,16,4,2434,25,5321,1416,11,4,119,5,13,2104,9,1622,29,51,10,218,37,68,25,2774,434,261,1416,8,1349,2326,1416,311,5,13,64,284,9,151,10,626,9,37,311,25,941,4,434,261,546,61,12,4,48,5,13,47,708,9,3040,169,134,7,4,90,81,16,70,20,227,10,137,4,324,8,4543,7,17,56,43,1051,5","0,1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",234,"0.00016260162601626038,0.5986052721483773,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.20841653873977484,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.026641150566293063,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.03524499734331625,0.011716455560495522,0.00016260162601626038,0.023384483133655997,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.008898049883154057,0.00016260162601626038,0.012646445959156304,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.0398028302568775,0.00016260162601626038,0.028139711368249894,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038,0.00016260162601626038"
