"governance of an agile software project . effective governance of agile software teams is challenging but required to enable wide adoption of agile methodologies , in particular for large scale projects in this paper we apply a full lifecycle governance model to agile projects , focused on the iteration level the concept is demonstrated via a case study of a large scale , enterprise critical software project that implemented agile practices we analyze three governance events , including the metrics that triggered the event , the decisions taken and the followup to ensure resolution we conclude that governance iterations can be naturally unified with agile development iterations , resulting in a lean governance mechanism that identifies and resolves issues in an effective and timely manner .","6040,7,24,2421,58,467,5,172,6040,7,2421,58,2214,14,582,108,512,10,763,492,1917,7,2421,2612,6,11,240,12,63,181,752,11,17,35,13,624,9,583,3980,6040,33,10,2421,752,6,862,16,4,2229,150,4,386,14,1096,357,9,231,105,7,9,63,181,6,1354,662,58,467,15,404,2421,1806,13,571,196,6040,443,6,242,4,540,15,5120,4,439,6,4,1162,1438,8,4,20774,10,1591,667,13,2567,15,6040,3230,27,28,1428,1010,18,2421,163,3230,6,556,11,9,8234,6040,618,15,1803,8,6881,446,11,24,172,8,3593,971,5","0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",126,"0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.05019981339108829,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.10963505902151331,0.00027777777777777783,0.01551073150864772,0.024785265473849186,0.017631832832943874,0.16007607726179293,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.1318886930609764,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.4461257527442736,0.01878485963196596,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.014250803961837871,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783,0.00027777777777777783"
"multi dispatch in the java virtual machine ( poster session ) design and implementation . mainstream object oriented languages , such as c and java , provide only a restricted form of polymorphic methods , namely single receiver dispatch in common programming situations , programmers must work around this limitation we detail how to extend the java virtual machine to support multiple dispatch and examine the complications that java imposes on multiple dispatch in practice our technique avoids changes to the java programming language itself , maintains source code and library compatibility , and isolates the performance penalty and semantic changes of multiple dispatch to the program sections which use it we have micro benchmark and application level performance results for a dynamic most specific applicable ( msa ) dispatcher , two table based dispatchers ( multiple row displacement ( mrd ) and single receiver projections ( srp ) ) , and a tuned srp dispatcher our general purpose technique provides smaller dispatch latency than equivalent programmer written double dispatch code . rn","192,4522,11,4,504,330,316,23,2420,1050,22,102,8,222,5,3469,155,233,246,6,39,21,528,8,504,6,131,113,9,1921,291,7,2539,72,6,1049,239,5081,4522,11,312,178,1725,6,1167,481,110,1070,17,2454,13,1127,88,10,868,4,504,330,316,10,160,154,4522,8,1124,4,9156,15,504,4929,16,154,4522,11,590,26,151,2711,358,10,4,504,178,94,1300,6,3279,216,143,8,1266,3632,6,8,10003,4,68,3762,8,213,358,7,154,4522,10,4,127,3368,31,76,34,13,47,2045,975,8,171,150,68,45,12,9,170,120,206,1311,23,19934,22,12511,6,59,1257,29,3,23,154,3467,3800,23,3,22,8,239,5081,2785,23,18404,22,22,6,8,9,3297,18404,12511,26,209,734,151,225,1631,4522,1677,99,1396,1621,1183,3604,4522,143,5,1871","0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",173,"0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.03726596898179998,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.014364614425159525,0.00019999999999999996,0.021775421370023376,0.00019999999999999996,0.054706625740955354,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.019752721585818978,0.03242942289779675,0.00019999999999999996,0.11922615344415945,0.00019999999999999996,0.058130979854481526,0.00019999999999999996,0.01966304023071834,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.010221433380619182,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.08571417586874554,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.012404893743453585,0.015273237161312429,0.29735989615525044,0.00019999999999999996,0.014183749088856843,0.1807276660708485,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996,0.00019999999999999996"
